# Stacks streaming protocol :man_in_tuxedo:

The key functionalities implemented are:

1. Anyone is be able to create a new stream

2. The creator of the stream can "refuel" the stream by adding new tokens to be used for ongoing payment

3. The recipient of the stream can withdraw any pending tokens they've accumulated up until that point

4. The creator of the stream can withdraw any excess tokens that may have been locked in the stream

5. The parameters of the stream - such as time range - are updated only if both parties provide consent for it
